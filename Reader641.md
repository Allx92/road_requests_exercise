### The Library of Congress Collections Portal
----
This portal contains links to all of the available digital collections which can be filtered and sorted.

#### API View
-----
The collections portal when requested via the API is JSON list of collections 

### Specific Collections
------
Specific collections contain links to items within the collection which contain detailed information about the item.

#### API View
----
The specific collection when returned via the API is a JSON list of items within the collection. The items have detailed attributes (name, value pairs).

When viewed from the command line the information about the collection is harder to read via the command line, easier in Firefox and easiest on the website, but for a program the command line/programmatic access of the returned data would be most useful since the JSON can be parsed and relevant information extracted by the program.
