# Requests Exercise

I chose the "America Singing: Nineteenth-Century Song Sheets" for this exercise(https://www.loc.gov/collections/nineteenth-century-song-sheets/).


#### Browser JSON View 
* Each collection item is identified by "number:"(for e.g "0:", "1:") and is segmented into several variables which provide details about the item
* The ability to collapse certain sections along with the indentation increased its readability

#### Python Console JSON View 
* Each collection item is identified by braces("{}") and is segmented into several variables which provide details about the item.
  * Variables that contain multiple variables/items use square brackets("[]")
* The information was somewhat squished together which, while discernible under close review, became muddled and overwhelming when looked at as a whole 

#### General Thoughts/Observations
* Overall the website was easy to navigate
 * Individual items are clearly seperated and the filters along the side such as date and location would be very helpful for persons who know specifically what they want
* There were repeat copies of the same items, though they were from notably different sources(paper quality, completely different sheets)

#### JSON Thoughts/Observations   
* Browser JSON View is much easier to read than the Python JSON view since it is collapsible and laid out cleaner
* Was reasonably easy to see the correlation between the JSON variables and what the user sees through the regular site view
* Information not visible from the web page view could be seen
