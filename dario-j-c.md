### To Infinity and Beyond

I recently had watched a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/fG8SwAFQFuU?si=Eg1Ozdhur4K3w0aj), from someone I follow and the responses he got surprised me. Curated though they may be, I had assumed a bit of what he said was common knowledge, which really reveals some of my biases and preconceptions about common knowledge. I also don't have a leg to stand on, ask me about the names for **anywhere** in Barbados more than a mile from my home, and I *guarantee* I don't know it.

What's my point here? Ideas about the universe are fresh in my mind and so the collection entitled, [*Finding Our Place in the Cosmos: From Galileo to Sagan and Beyond*](https://www.loc.gov/collections/finding-our-place-in-the-cosmos-with-carl-sagan/about-this-collection/) really clicks with me.

The collection describes itself with the following words:
> A thematic collection exploring changing models of the universe through time, ideas of life on other words and Carl Saganâ€™s place in the tradition of science. It features manuscripts, rare books, celestial atlases, newspaper articles, sheet music and movie posters.

### Standard View Html

#### Pale Blue Dot *And Other Pixels*

People interact with the world mostly through sight, and having the images makes the experience as a user much more immersive. It's not just text, but actual pictures, which I assume is as good at it gets, excluding the real thing.

### JSON

#### Browser

#### Command Line

## Aspects to Compare about the Collection

This is not an exhaustive list, but should give some direction in what to look at

- What's generally interesting about the collection to you?
  - Have a general look, then breakdown by html and json in browser & command-line
- How is it structured?
  - Compare html and json, similarities and differences
- How was navigating the data
  - For html & json state in browser & command line: ease of use, similarities and differences
  - Note any idiosyncrasies for the three different methods
  - Note naming conventions
  - Note choices made in the organising, maybe consider why they were made and their likely trade-offs
- Note how you may want to use the data
