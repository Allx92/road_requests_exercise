# Food and Foodways Web Archive 

https://www.loc.gov/collections/food-and-foodways-web-archive/

## Normal Webpage View

* There's options to filter the type of collection items seen and how these items are displayed (i.e. in a list or gallery etc.)
  
* Each collection item displayed has a brief description and title which makes it easy for the web user to identify a specific item.
  
* There's an about section which allows the web user to get a gist of what the collection contains.
  
* Each collection item has a very user friendly page showing the item (captures), meta data (title etc.), rights and citation information. 

## JSON Format

https://www.loc.gov/collections/food-and-foodways-web-archive/?fo=json&at=results

* The colelction data is displayed as easily readable key value pairs.

## Command Line View

* The request object allows you view information outside of the collection data and content, like the request status (whether it was successful or not), the response time elapsed, the encoding used etc.
  * The response time could be tested to see how quickly the interface provides the requested data.

* The request object also provides the raw collection data, as a blob of text. It's not as easy on the eyes like the JSON format or webpage view.
